Here goes Day1



In order to survive in infosec you got to know atleast a programming language especially a scripting language like python, so i started learning it.



This is what i've done so far



1. Basics 

 Since i'm not a complete beginner to programming my basics were good   so i just did a quick review of basics like functions,loops,conditionals,lists, dictionaries etc.



2. Modelling a real life object into code - OOPs

	 I wanted to model a coffee vending machine,first i did this using procedural approach, then i understood the problem with tradtional methods and why Object oriented programming was needed ,it was hectic to remember all those relations between each functions just for a single project then i did the same using OOPs then i realized its importance.  



3. Turtle library For the past couple of days i created two projects using this gui library.

	

   i) The Snake game üêç

   ii) The Pong gameüèì



With these projects i learned 

- Abstraction and Inheritance concepts. 

- Reading official python docs in order to work with new libraries in future.

- Learned to use Modules such as time,random 

- Creating simple GUI's 



So far everything is going good.
