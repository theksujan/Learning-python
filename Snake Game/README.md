For the past couple of days i created two projects using a python's  gui library called Turtle.

   i) The Snake game 🐍

   ii) The Pong game🏓



With these projects i learned 

- Abstraction and Inheritance concepts. 

- Reading official python docs in order to work with new libraries in future.

- Learned to use Modules such as time,random 

- Creating simple GUI's
